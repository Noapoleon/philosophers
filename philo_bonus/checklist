TODO:

THINK ABOUT:
	- Compile with both gcc and clang to see stuff
	- When two intances of philo_bonus are launch isn't that gonna fuck up the
	  next ones??
	- simulation termination should not just exit the philos but instead close
	  the links so the semaphores, so maybe i need an exit variable, WAIT maybe
	  i don't need that actually if i just kill the process and unlink in main

DONE:
